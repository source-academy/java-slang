# CSEC Machine

The CSEC Machine is an implementation of the CSE notional machine. This machine extends the CSE notional machine with an additional component, Classes, to better reflect Java's semantics in a learner-friendly manner.

The implementation architecture of the CSEC machine is described in [Architecture](./architecture.md).

## CSEC Machine Components

- [Control](control.md)
- [Stash](stash.md)
- [Environment](environment.md)
- [Classes](classes.md)
