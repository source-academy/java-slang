\subsection*{Restrictions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Explicit constructor invocations are only allowed in constructor bodies.

\item Multiplicative binary operators, i.e., \textbf{\texttt{*}}, \textbf{\texttt{/}}, \textbf{\texttt{\%}} have higher precedence than additive binary operators, i.e., \textbf{\texttt{+}}, \textbf{\texttt{-}}.
Also, multiplicative and additive binary operators are left associative.

\item Only assignments and method invocations are allowed as expression in expression statements.

\end{itemize}
